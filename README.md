<h3>ECE BOARD EXAM PROBLEM</h3>
<h4>Using data wrangling and data visualization techniques with storytelling, analyze the data and present different (i) data frames; and (ii) visuals using the dataset given.</h4>
1. Create the following data frames based on the format provided: Example: Vis = [“Name”, “Gender”, “Track”, “Math<70”]; hometown is constant as Visayas. <br><br>
1A. Filename: Instru = [“Name”, “GEAS”, “Electronics >70”]; where track is constant as Instrumentation and hometown Luzon <br>
1B. Filename: Mindy = [ “Name”, “Track”, “Electronics”, “Average >=55”]; where hometown is constant as Mindanao and gender Female<br><br>
2. Create a visualization that shows how the different features contribute to the average grade. Does a chosen track in college, gender, or hometown contribute to a higher average score?

  
# Insights
<h3>PROBLEM 1</h3>
The problems were relatively straightforward. Heavily utilizing the loc function to gather the required output. A challenging bit of the problem was 1B, as creating a new average column proved more complex. Using the .mean on the four subjects was not enough. The user must specify the axis to get the correct output. Besides that, Problem 1 is straightforward.
<h3>PROBLEM 2</h3>
Problem 2 is quite a task. As matplot is new to me, it took time to learn the basics. So, creating the simple bar plot took some time, but ultimately, the goal of visualizing the data was achieved.
